Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software enginerring is the using of engineering principles and modules to create and maintain high quality software.
It is importance as it allows one to develop and create various systems relevant to a speicific fields eg communication and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the introduction of structured programming- The developement of led to use of structured control flows such as loops and subroutines.
object oriented programming-this lead to the rise where programs were organized around objects rather than actions
the rise of agile methodologies-It revolutionized software development by promoting iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Gathering-this is where requirements are defined from users and system requirements from stakeholders where they would later be analyzed.
planning phase- It involves planning, scheduling and  cost estimation.It defines the overall project scope.
Desing phase-The stage where the requirements are transformed into a module it can both include diagrams.
Implementation-This is where it is transformed into code form depending on the system requirements.
Testing-After implementing the code it is done testing like unit,regression testing to ensure its functionality and if its meets the requirements and ensuring to fix all bugs.
Deployment and maintenace-this is when the software is released to the market and maintenance to fix any issues that may arise later on.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
the waterfall methodolgy follows a sequential process where a phase must be completed before moving to another one while agile methodology  is a flexible and cyclical, delivering small parts of the project at a certain time  and going back to previous phases like design, development, and testing continuously.
testing is done after the development phase in waterfall while esting is done contionusly in agile methodology.
waterfall is most appropriate in scenarios Developing a banking system that requires strict adherence to regulatory standards and security protocols. 
For Agile methodoly when creating a communication platform like either facebook or instagram as where updates are made frequently.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for  creating ,writing and mainting software code based on specifications.He/She is also responsible for also conducting unit and regression testing.
A quality assurance engineer is responsible for ensuring the quality of the software product by systematically testing it to find and report bugs.He/She develops and executes test cases to identify defects in software they are also responsible for reporting and tracking defects, working with developers to resolve them.
Project Manager is responsible for planning, executing, and overseeing the software project to ensure it is completed on time, within budget, and meets the stakeholders' goals. They are responsible for defining the project scope, objectives, and timelines and ensures the project is within the allocated budget.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment-provide code assistance that provide intelligent code suggestions, auto-completion, and syntax highlighting, helping developers write code faster with fewer errors.They also integrate with version control systems (VCS), allowing developers to manage code commits, branches, and merges directly from the IDE interface.  an example ans visual studio code and eclipse.
Version control Systems-allows collaboration with multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.
it also allows foe efficiently tracking as every change to the codebase is tracked, allowing developers to see who made changes and when they were made allowing for easy rollbacking when an error occurs.an example are git and mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.'
Changing Requirements it is may be difficult adapting to evolving project requirements throughout the development process.it can be resolved through appling methodolgies like agile as it has flexibility and using version control like git.
Meeting deadlines as most software face tight deadlines and poor time management can lead to burnouts and not meeting the deadlines.this can be resloved using task proiritization depending on the urgency and the time.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing-It is the testing the software individual componets.It is important in early bug detection before they propogate to other parts of code.
integration testing- it the type of testing the interactions between different components or modules of a software system.It is used to ensure that ensures that components that work in isolation also function correctly when interacting with other components. 
System testing-it is the type of testing the system as a whole.System testing verifies that the entire system functions correctly and also validating both functional and non-functional requirements.
acceptance testing-the testing done before released the users.it is used to ensure the software satsfies both the business requirements.To also ensures it satisfies the functional and non-functional requirements defined by the stakeholders.

Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to be able to get the best response from an ai model.It,s importance is it allows users to get the most accurate and useful results from an AI model.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a vague propmpt is "tell me about cars" and improved propmpt is "tell me about fast cars made in the year 2022"-it is more efficient as you are specific and can get a clear response from the AI model.As you want only fast cars and in the year 2022.
